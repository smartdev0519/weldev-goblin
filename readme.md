> [gobinaries](https://gobinaries.com/) alternative

Simply put it's a lot of code that's been picked up from the original [gobinaries](https://github.com/tj/gobinaries)
and the majority of the reason is that most of the research for the work has been already done there.

The reason for another repo is that the development on gobinaries has been slow for the past few months / years at this point
and go has moved up 2 version and people are still waiting for gobinaries to update itself.

**All credits to [tj](github.com/tj) for the idea and the initial implementation.**

## Why not fork?

To keep it short, it's fun to build the arch from scratch, helps you learn.
Also the mentality of both the authors differ.

(was easier to start from scratch then remove each blocking thing from the original one)
