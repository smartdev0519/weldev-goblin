> [gobinaries](https://gobinaries.com/) alternative

Simply put it's a lot of code that's been picked up from the original [gobinaries](https://github.com/tj/gobinaries)
and the majority of the reason is that most of the research for the work has been already done there.

The reason for another repo is that the development on gobinaries has been slow for the past few months / years at this point
and go has moved up 2 version and people are still waiting for gobinaries to update itself.

## Why not fork?

Cause it's not the same as gobinaries, I have picked up code from the original repo as reference for the builds but it was all written again. Also the original is tied to GCP, Apex Logs and other services thus making it hard for anyone to spin up their own version of the binary service

# Note

WIP! HACKY TO THE CORE.

## Working Features

- [ ] Curl Request scripts and Renders
- [x] Create a local build of the hardcoded package
- [x] Upload it to a storage service
- [ ] Fetch from the storage service (part of the request scripts)
- [ ] Finally host this thing
